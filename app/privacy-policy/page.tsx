                            We only gather some minor data while you surf our site. Firstly,
                            we collect your IP address through our Internet access logs. When you
                            access Fininfolib, your Internet address is automatically collected
                            and recorded in our Internet access logs. We use this IP address to enable us
                            to diagnose problems with our web server, to administer our website, and to refine our
                            site based on the pages visited and features and contents found interesting by visitors.
                            Your IP address is also
                            used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

                            We also use cookies to gather some data about visitors.
                            A "cookie" is a small piece of data about your visit to our site for example,
                            how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was
                            of interest to you. The website sends this information to your browser, which may then be
                            stored on your system. Currently, we are using cookies only in a select few pages. But we do
                            have the plan to use it more extensively in the near future so that we can provide you with better
                            results from our site. However, you have complete freedom to set your browser to notify you when
                            you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. In the case
                            you do not wish to receive any cookies, you can change your browser settings in the Preferences
                            or Options menu to completely block the usage of cookies.

                            Simple browsing through Fininfolib does not
                            require you to submit any personal data. The only point at which we ask for
                            personal data is for voluntary registration, Online Quote or subscription for
                            white papers, article archives, or our newsletter. The personal data collected will
                            not be sold or provided to any outside entities and will be used solely by Fin Infolib
                            for a one-on-one contact with registrants. Any information that we have collected or
                            stored about you may be transferred to a future purchaser of our company and/or its assets.
                            The data collected is stored in a secure server located at our data centre with our ISP,
                            which will take periodic backups of it but will not give
                            or sell them to anyone outside of Fin Infolib.
